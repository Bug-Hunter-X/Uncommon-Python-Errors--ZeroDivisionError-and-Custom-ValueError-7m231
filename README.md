This repository demonstrates two types of errors in Python that, while technically common error types, can be less frequently encountered in simple programs. 

* **ZeroDivisionError:** This error occurs when attempting division by zero.  It's often caught with simple checks, but can be missed in more complex scenarios.
* **ValueError:**  This is a more general-purpose exception. This example explicitly raises a ValueError to show the custom error handling capability.

The `bug.py` file shows the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.py` provides an improved version with robust error handling.
